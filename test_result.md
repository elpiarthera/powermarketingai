# VidCraft AI - Test Results and Protocol

## Testing Protocol

### General Guidelines
- MUST ALWAYS READ and UPDATE this file before invoking any testing agent
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_cloud`
- After backend testing, STOP to ask user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly requests it
- NEVER fix something that has already been fixed by testing agents
- Take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file

### Test Execution Protocol
1. Read current test status from this file
2. Execute targeted tests based on recent changes
3. Update this file with results
4. Report findings to main agent
